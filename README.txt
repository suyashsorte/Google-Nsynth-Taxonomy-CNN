The main objective of the project is to classify single note recordings of instruments into one of 10 instrument family names(e.g: mallet, organ, piano, strings, guitar, etc.)
Each recording is 4 seconds long; the last second is just the release of the note (e.g., after lifting a piano key). The sample rate is 16kHz (16,000 samples/second i.e. 64,000 samples over the four seconds).
